# Tailwind 4 Vue Starter

[Follow this guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/vue/) to learn how to set up Tailwind CSS v4 with Vue and Flowbite.

Vue.js is a popular front-end library based on reactivity and declarative rendering used by websites such as Behance, Nintendo, Gitlab, Font Awesome, and more that you can use to build modern web applications.

By installing Tailwind CSS and Flowbite you can build your project even faster using the utility-first approach from Tailwind and the interactive UI components from Flowbite, such as modals, tables, dropdowns, datepickers, and more.
